- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeMaitoza
- 👀 I build AI-driven Python SaaS apps, often collaborating with another agentic creator.
- 🌱 When I'm not coding, I'm composing music -- blending logic with creativity.
- 💞️ I'm an imperfect follower of Jesus, walking in faith with humility, outside the noise of rigid labels.
- ✨Always learning, experimenting, and sharing what I build.
- 📫 How to reach me: mikemaitoza@outlook.com
